# VisionCraft Labs - Deployment Status & Email Fix

## Current Issue
The Netlify deployment is using an outdated function that lacks SendGrid email integration, causing contact forms and file uploads to fail silently.

## Root Cause
The deployed Netlify function (`netlify/functions/server.js`) doesn't include the SendGrid email code that's working in development.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the Netlify function with:
- SendGrid API integration (@sendgrid/mail)
- Professional email templates for contact forms
- Image upload notifications
- Proper error handling and logging
- Environment variable configuration

## Deployment Requirements

### 1. Netlify Environment Variable
Add to Netlify site settings:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY = (your SendGrid API key)
```

### 2. Deploy Updated Function
The updated `netlify/functions/server.js` needs to be deployed to Netlify. This can be done by:
- Triggering a manual deploy in Netlify dashboard
- Pushing changes to the connected Git repository

## Verification Steps
After deployment, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST https://visioncraft-labs.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","message":"Test message"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{"success":true,"message":"Contact form submitted successfully","emailSent":true}
```

## Email Features Working
- Contact form submissions → Professional email to visioncraftlabs@gmail.com
- Image uploads → Notification email with client details
- HTML templates with proper formatting
- Phone field integration
- Error handling and fallback responses

## Current Status
- ✅ Email functionality confirmed working in development
- ✅ SendGrid integration code complete
- ✅ Professional email templates ready
- ⏳ Netlify deployment needed
- ⏳ Environment variable configuration required

The fix is ready - deployment will restore full email functionality to the live site.
