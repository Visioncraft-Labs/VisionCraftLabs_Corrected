# Netlify Email Fix - Quick Deployment Guide

## Issue Identified
The Netlify function is returning 404 errors because the deployed version doesn't include the SendGrid email integration. The current function lacks email sending capabilities.

## Fix Applied
Updated `netlify/functions/server.js` with:
- SendGrid API integration
- Professional email templates
- Contact form email notifications
- Image upload email notifications
- Error handling and logging

## Required Environment Variable
The Netlify site needs the SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable configured.

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Manual Netlify Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → visioncraft-labs site
2. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add: `SENDGRID_API_KEY` = (your SendGrid API key)
4. Go to Deploys → Trigger Deploy → Deploy Site

### Option 2: Git Push Deploy
1. Commit changes to repository
2. Push to main branch
3. Netlify will auto-deploy with new function

## Testing After Deploy
```bash
# Test contact form
curl -X POST https://visioncraft-labs.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","message":"Test message"}'

# Should return: {"success":true,"message":"Contact form submitted successfully","emailSent":true}
```

## Email Configuration
- **To:** visioncraftlabs@gmail.com
- **From:** visioncraftlabs@gmail.com  
- **Templates:** Professional HTML with contact details
- **Notifications:** Both contact forms and image uploads trigger emails

## Current Status
- ✅ SendGrid integration code ready
- ✅ Email templates created
- ⏳ Waiting for Netlify deployment
- ⏳ Environment variable configuration needed

The fix is complete and ready for deployment.
